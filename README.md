# Mobile-Video-Restoration


## Challenge Description

Mobile internet has been infiltrating and changing people’s lives. For instance, capturing and sharing videos has become a new trend. In fact, huge amount of video is being generated and consumed every day. However, compared with videos generated by professionals, mobile videos may suffer from low quality since they can be generated by unskilled amateurs with low-end capture devices under poor shooting condition. Also, contents being shared across different platforms or social networks may be transcoded multiple times, which may result in serious quality degradation.

The aim of this challenge is to solicit original contributions addressing restoration of mobile videos that will help improve the quality of experience of video viewers and advance the state-of-the-art in video restoration. Although quality degradation of videos occurs in various phases (e.g., capturing, encoding, storage, transmitting, etc.), we simplify the problem in this challenge as a post-processing problem. 

Participants will be given a set of degraded videos captured by mobile devices, where the degradation may come from multiple sources. Partial decoding information will also be provided and we encourage the participants to make use of this kind information or even dump other information themselves. Participants are requested to recover the high-quality version of degraded videos. We are interested in all kinds of mobile video restoration algorithms: from traditional signal processing to deep learning approaches.


## Prize Pool

The total prize pool is xxx. The winner will be awarded xxx, the runner-up will be awarded xxx, the third place will be awarded xxx.


## Evaluation Criteria

Restoration results of each proposal will be evaluated using objective (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, VMAF, …) and subjective (MOS) quality scores. The speed of each algorithm given limited resources will also be measured. The final score will be a weighted combination of different aspects.


## Submission Guidelines

Register/Submission site: http://xxx

Submissions should provide restoration results of corresponding degraded videos, a detailed technical description in the form of a short paper, and source code to reproduce the results and measure the performance of the submission.
