# How to Use

It is not efficient to upload the results YUV files due to their sizes. So we offer a high quality Encoder which compresses raw YUV into mp4 with high bitrate. The output MP4 could be used for the results submission.

Usage: .

```
/encoder_macosx <input.yuv> <widthxheight> <framerate> <output.mp4>
```

Example: 

```
./encoder_macosx 001.yuv 720x1280 30 001.mp4
```
